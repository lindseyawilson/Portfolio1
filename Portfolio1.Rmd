```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

My goal in this first portfolio project is to recreate a graph from my first year project poster.
A screenshot of the graph is below:


```{r original-image, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("FirstYearProjGraph.png")
```

The first thing we need to do is import the data, which I've done below.
The data was originally wide, and I restructured it to long format in SPSS.
Definitely not a long-term solution, but I wanted this project to focus on the graphics (I'll try the restructuring in R for one of my future portfolio projects).

```{r import-data}
library(haven)
data <- read_sav("Long_HWInitialAnalysis.sav")
```
